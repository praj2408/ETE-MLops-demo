## Insurance Premium Prediction
The goal of this project is to give people an estimate of how much they need based on their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health insurance carrier and its plans and perks while keeping the projected cost from our study in mind. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an
insurance policy rather than the ineffective part.

## Model information
The machine learning model used in this project is a catboost regression model, which was trained using scikit-learn. The model takes in demographic and medical information about an individual and predicts their insurance premium.

## Results and analysis

After training the model, we achieved an R-squared value of 0.88 (88% accuracy) on the test data, indicating a moderate level of predictive power. We also created visualizations to explore the relationships between different features and insurance premiums.
